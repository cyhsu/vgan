   Visualization of Glider AUV Network 
=========================================
The real-time interactive data dashboard for oceanic gliders and modeling systems  

The fundamental glider scientific mission in the Gulf of Mexico remains to collect real-time temperature and salinity data and eventually assimilate these data into the coupled atmospheric (hurricane)-ocean modeling system to improve forecasts and hurricane weather model. One of the current challenges has been data visualization. In this project, we discuss the development of a unique real-time responsive web-platform for the integration of monitoring and modeling these data. This web-platform is python-based, so that offers multi-functionalities to meet the typical needs of a glider mission;  for example, the glider geolocation visualization navigation on the GIS map, the data vision of associated mounted-sensors, the comparisons between gliders and model systems, and highlight the total contribution of the participating institutes by using a calendar heatmap, just like the Github commit history.

We thanks teams of Xarray, Ipywidgets, Ipyleaflet since we use those packages to construct our python package, and special thanks to the HYCOM to provide their hindcast output. We also appreciated presenting our work in the OCEANS-Gulf Coast 2020.
